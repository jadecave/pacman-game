I highly recommened subscribing to her YouTube channel because her concrete videos help me tremendously to understand what JavaScript is all about. And to watch her super simple walkthourgh to coding Pac-Man in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. View [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw) 

Please tag the original creator, @kubowania as I would LOVE to see your game!!!

In this game I show you how to make Pac-Man move around the grid while avoiding walls, show you how to use the constructor method for all four ghosts to apply their unque characterisitcs to each one, including at what speed they move at. Clyde obviously being the slowest.
